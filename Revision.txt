For my revision project, I chose to revise my Literacy Narrative Essay because it had the greatest opportunities for improvement in overall structure and clarity. I focused on one Global Writing Concern: Argument / Thesis Cohesion and Logical Progression, and one Local Writing Concern: Clarity (S.V.O.) and Concision. My goal was to make the narrative flow more smoothly while maintaining the details, emotion, and storytelling present in my original draft.

In my original draft, several paragraphs jumped quickly between events without fully connecting them. The story moved from the war to the library, to school reopening, to later school years in a way that sometimes felt abrupt. To address this, I revised the narrative to create a clearer sense of progression and cause-and-effect. I strengthened transitions between major stages of the narrative, especially from: leaving home because of the war to discovering the library, returning to school after the war and relating to Harry Potter, and finally from ninth grade to the 2020 pandemic and my high school identity. I added clearer explanations of why each event mattered, showing how each moment contributed to my growth as a reader and student, and I reorganized sentences in several paragraphs to ensure the story follows a smooth chronological arc.
My original draft also had many sentences that were long, had repeated ideas, or contained small grammatical issues.

Some details were buried inside long phrases, and a few sentences included unnecessary filler. To improve clarity, I shortened overly long sentences, so they focused on a clear subject. I removed repetition, such as restating the same emotional reactions or describing settings more than once. I corrected wordiness and replaced vague expressions with more precise wording. I improved sentence flow within paragraphs, making sure each sentence contributes something meaningful instead of slowing the pacing. I also decided to remove the parenthesis explanations of the terms used as they were unnecessary fillers and looked unappealing.

This revision showed me how there is always room for improvement and demonstrated how much I grew as a writer, as I had initially thought that my essay was my greatest work.
