YOU DIED: THE ART OF FAILING FORWARD IN ELDEN RING 
You swing your sword. Miss. Die. Try again. Hour after hour, until at last, after numerous failed attempts, you see “Enemy Felled” pop up on your screen and the feeling of victory is unlike anything you ever experienced. That is Elden ring, developed by Fromsoftware, one of the hardest videogames of the past decade. Set in the shattered world of The Lands Between, it follows the story of the Tarnished, an exiled warrior destined to either restore or reshape the world’s broken order. While most modern games prioritize instant gratification and making the player feel powerful, FromSoftware decides to take a different approach, forcing the player to adapt through relentless difficulty and repeated failure. Every encounter demands patience and precision, swing too early or dodge too late, you die. Rather than punishing players, Elden ring teaches them how to adapt, analyze, and improve, transforming frustration into motivation. While many think that Elden Ring’s notorious difficulty is merely intended to frustrate or exclude players, its deliberate challenge serves as a form of instruction teaching players analytical thinking and problem-solving under pressure. 
FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki views difficulty as a fundamental component of the emotional and psychological rewards of gaming, not as an obstacle to drive players away. He says in an interview “The Soulslike genre … puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent approach, players can recognize patterns, develop skills, and … pass the trials to progress through the game”(Miyazaki), showing that he intends for the challenges to test players by making them observe, learn and persist, key components in problem-solving, patience, and adaptation. Failure in these games forces players to learn from their mistakes and to make better decisions going forward.Miyazaki emphasizes that this difficulty is meant to feel fair rather than arbitrary: “When players are killed and they can understand why … and it feels justified, that’s the game design we’re trying to achieve” (Miyazaki).  The core philosophy of FromSoftware and the ‘Soulslike’ genre is that hardship is essential to the player experience and that struggle and perseverance are not just byproducts, but the very essence of play.
 	Part of the game’s design is to give the players freedom to do anything, allowing them to approach challenges at their own pace instead of brute-forcing it. One example of this is the first major field boss encounter in the open world, the Tree Sentinel. Many players initially attempt to confront the Tree Sentinel head-on, only to discover that they are vastly underprepared for the fight. This boss is intentionally designed to teach players one of the most important strategies in overcoming the difficulty, retreating, going elsewhere and leveling up so they don’t have to “bang their head against a wall over and over”(Miyazaki). Elden Ring’s non-linear design and lack of ‘handholding’ also promotes experimentation and strategic decision-making. By giving players complete freedom in building their character by analyzing the strength and weaknesses of different classes, weapons, spells and stats. For instance, a player switching from a strength based melee build to an intelligence-based sorcery and magic learns how to reassess their resources, teaching them strategic evaluation and adaptability.
Through its intricate combat system and expansive open world, Elden Ring turns gameplay into a cognitive exercise. Boss fights like Malenia, Blade of Miquella exemplify how Elden Ring turns difficulty into a test of problem-solving, where her unpredictable attack sequences, health-regenerating strikes, and punishing speed forces players to abandon memorizing attack patterns and to engage in dynamic pattern recognition instead. This kind of cognitive flexibility is the core of real-world problem solving, where persistence and analysis lead to mastery. In addition to that, Elden Ring deliberately limits the number of checkpoints and healing items, compelling players to pick their fights and calculate routes carefully, building foresight and composure under pressure. This is how Miyazaki’s design principle works in practice, through the learning loop that mirrors real-world problem solving, which starts with failure, reflection, adjustment and finally leads to success.

Beyond its mental challenges, Elden Ring fosters emotional maturity by rewarding calm determination over impulsive frustration. Throughout the game, players are shifting through a constant phase of despair and triumph, which forces them to have emotional regulation in order to succeed. Every death creates emotional friction, increasing anger and anxiety, but the only path to victory is to stay calm and focused. Long boss fights like Starscourge Radhan demonstrate this, where consistency and mental endurance are more important to win than reflexes. This can even be applied to real life, where motivation throughout failure is the only way to success. The idea that ability is developed through patience and practice rather than innate talent is what psychologist Carol Dweck calls a “Growth Mindset”(6). This dopamine cycle makes victory after struggle much more rewarding and teaches that persistence through emotional discomfort leads to mastery, encouraging players to seek this feeling in the outside world.

The community surrounding Elden Ring and other Soulslike titles also play a significant role in affecting how the player approaches some parts of the game, transforming difficulty from an isolating experience to a collaborative one. Originating in the first FromSoftware game, Dark Souls, the phrase ‘Git-Gud’, which means get good, was what players in the community used on those who couldn’t beat certain obstacles, simply telling them to improve through skill alone. This slogan formed a community of ‘try-hards’ who think that the only right way to beat the game is to use the hardest path possible, discouraging players from using co-op, summons, or any other playstyle they deem too easy. FromSoftware, on the other hand, is against this type of elitism, and offers multiple valid ways to overcome challenges in the game, undermining the rigid ‘skill only’ approach to the game. Online guides, messages left on the ground by other players and co-op play are all considered to be an informal learning network that players can collaboratively use to adjust to difficulty. Messages like “try fire” or “be wary of ambush” are great demonstrations of how players can give insightful tips to each other or warn of upcoming dangers. Players who find these tips useful can applaud the message, automatically healing the writer in return, providing mutual benefit to all. Mateusz Felczak argues in his essay “The ‘Git Gud’ Fallacy: Challenge and Difficulty in Elden Ring” that the ‘Git-Gud’ mentality misread the game’s intent, and that Elden Ring was not meant to exclude players, but to build a cooperative environment that encourages learning and experimentation(Felczak). Felczak writes that Elden Ring’s structure encourages creative problem-solving rather than mechanical perfection (Felczak), which shows that there are multiple paths to success. By transforming struggle into a shared, relatable experience, Elden Ring can build both personal and communal approaches to overcome struggle.
Just as teachers use difficult examples in class and on exams to foster deep learning, Elden Ring uses strict obstacles as a tool to encourage meaningful learning. The mental habits developed like analytical thinking and adaptive strategy are precisely what educators value in academic and professional settings. Players learn through trial and error, which resembles how students tackle complex problems at school, and how workers treat setbacks in their fields. The article, “Engaging Difficulty in Adult Education” argues that productive struggle, in the form of intentional and meaningful challenges, can indeed result in learning and self-efficacy (Roecklin, 35). According to the article, learners benefit when the difficulty actually demands them to reflect, strategize, and adapt rather than seeking immediate reward. This directly falls in line with Elden Ring’s design loop of failure, reflection, and adaptation. The intrinsic motivation that players feel when conquering challenges provides great satisfaction because they succeeded out of effort, not in the search of any external reward. In real life, this kind of motivation leads to a deeper understanding of topics and a longer retention of information, because it makes people actually want to improve, rather than getting rewarded easily. 
	At first glance, Elden Ring’s difficulty may seem designed to push players towards despair, but the further you get into the game, the more you realize that its challenge is a deliberate tool for growth. What begins as a test of reflexes quickly turns into a lesson in perseverance, by teaching the player that progress, in game and in life, requires patience and adaptability. The joy of overcoming hardships shapes not only the gameplay experience, but the player’s mindset as well. Through its brutal combat, moments of quiet exploration, and the shared struggles of its players, Elden Ring shows that struggle is not failure, but a process of learning and resilience that can be overcome by personal or collective growth. In the end, Elden Ring is more than a game about defeating monsters, but about understanding one’s limits and learning to persist beyond them. In a world that prizes quick, easy satisfaction, FromSoftware’s masterpiece challenges the norm and helps the player develop lasting habits that help them build up the courage to face challenges and to always try again in the shadow of failure.
