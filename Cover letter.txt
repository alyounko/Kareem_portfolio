      For my ePortfolio, I revised my Literacy Narrative Essay and transformed my Elden Ring analysis essay into a visual poster. These two projects represent my strongest growth as a writer in this course, and working on them helped me understand how to refine both the content and the presentation of my ideas.
      I decided to revise my literacy narrative essay since it had the most room for improvement. The first thing I decided to revise was the global concern, which was Argument/Thesis Cohesion and Logical Progression, because I felt that the organization of the essay and the pacing were a little off. I revised to shape the narrative into a clearer, chronological arc, which starts with my childhood and early reading, the outbreak of war, discovering my grandfather’s library, returning to school, developing academically, and finally reaching high school and my goals for the future. I strengthened transitions between these sections so that each moment leads naturally into the next and supports the central theme that reading became a source of strength and identity for me.
      For the local writing concern, I decided to improve clarity and concision. I did this by eliminating unnecessary filler words, such as the long explanations that I put in parenthesis, since the sentences were long and repetitive. I revised these by tightening the language, removing repeated phrasing, clarifying references, and making the writing easier to follow without losing any of the descriptive details. These line-level edits helped the narrative read more smoothly and made my ideas more precise.
      For the transformation project, I decided to transform my Elden Ring analysis essay into a visual poster. I chose this essay since I felt that it had the most potential to produce a visually appealing poster, while also maintaining the ideas presented in the essay. I added main idea that I talked about in the essay but replaced them in the poster with structured sections, quotes, and imagery to express the same argument in a more accessible and engaging way. The transformation shifted the focus from extended analysis to clear, digestible ideas that visually communicate how Elden Ring teaches resilience, strategy, and persistence.
